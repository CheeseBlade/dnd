<h3> <strong> Weapons </strong> </h3>
<p>
There are 2 types of weapons: melee, ranged.
<br>
Melee weapons hit creatures within 5 feet of the user unless otherwise stated.
<br>
Ranged weapons hit creatures at a distance this distance has a regular range and long range. If you make an attack on an enemy that is at a long range or within 5 feet of you, you get <u>disadvantage</u> on your <u>attack roll</u>.
</p>


<!-- Armor -->
<h3> <strong> Armor and Shields </strong> </h3>
<p>
All creatures have an armor class. Armor class determines whether an attack hits or not. Your armor class is determined by taking your base armor class and adding your <u>dexterity</u> modifier. Your base armor class is normally 10, but armor and certain races makes your base AC higher.
There are 3 types of armor - light, medium, and heavy. Heavier armor gives a higher base armor class but not every class can wear each armor (you can find what armor you can equip on the app or website you use for your character). There are also shields which add 2 to your AC.
</p>

<br>

<br>
10 gold makes one platinum
