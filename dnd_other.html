On this page you’ll find links to other sites to further your knowledge of dnd. These sites will be extremely useful as the contents of them will go into much more detail on all things dnd.

<p>
This is the official dnd site it contains all the rules, a character creator, and you can purchase the official dnd books and other resources from this site. I don’t recommend using this for its character creator as it limits your options to the contents of books that you’ve purchased.
</p>

This is a fantastic site for seeing all the rules of dnd, it is also great for seeing the stats of all the different monsters in the game.

If you’re playing dnd online this site is for you, it contains everything needed to build and use maps of the world.

<!-- 5e companion app -->
<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.blastervla.ddencountergenerator&hl=en_CA" title="companion"> <br> 5e Companion App </a>
<p>
This app is only available on mobile devices but it is highly recommended. It is fantastic for characters, it contains everything needed for your characters, and is a better character creator than dnd beyond because it gives access to all the content that exists, not just what you’ve purchased.
