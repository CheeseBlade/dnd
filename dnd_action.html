<h1> <strong> Action Uses </strong> </h1>
<h3> <strong> Attack </strong> </h3>
<p>
When you attack you make an <strong>attack roll</strong>. To make an <strong>attack roll</strong> you roll a d20 and add your <strong>modifier</strong> to hit with your weapon (your <strong>modifier</strong> will be shown on the website or app you use for your character sheet.) Once you have that number you compare it to the <strong>armor class</strong> of what you were attacking, if what you rolled is equal to or higher than the <strong>armor class</strong> your attack hits and you roll damage. Damage is determined by rolling the <strong>damage die</strong> for the weapon you used and adding your <strong>modifier</strong> to damage. (your <strong>damage die</strong> and <strong>modifier</strong> will be shown on the website or app you use for your character sheet.) If you roll a 20 on your attack roll before adding your modifier to hit you get a critical hit. When you get a critical hit you hit the enemy no matter what the enemy <strong>armor class</strong> is, and you roll 1 extra <strong>damage die</strong>.

Example - Steve makes an <strong>attack roll</strong> with his sword at an enemy. Steve has a <strong>modifier</strong> of  +3 to hit with his sword. He rolls a 12 adding his +3 for a total of 15. The enemy has 14 <strong>armor class</strong>, Steve rolled higher than 14 so his attack hits. When rolling damage Steve’s sword's <strong>damage die</strong> is 1d8, and he has a <strong>modifier</strong> of +2 to damage. He rolls a 4 and adds his +2 to damage for a total of 6 and the enemy he attacked takes 6 damage.

<h3> <strong> Grapple </strong> </h3>
<p>
Grappling someone is an action you can take while you are 5 feet from who you try to grapple. When you attempt to grapple someone an <strong>ability check contest</strong> happens. The person trying to grapple makes a <strong>strength</strong> check and the opponent makes either a <strong>strength</strong> or <strong>dexterity</strong> check. Whoever rolls higher wins the contest, if the opponent wins nothing happens, if the person who is trying to grapple wins then they grapple the opponent. When you are grappled you can’t move but you can still use every other action. To escape grapple the person that is grappled can attempt to escape and do another <strong>ability check contest</strong>.
