<h1> <strong> Characters </strong> </h1>
<p>
Your character is who you play as, there are a multitude of possibilities, but first what makes up a character. Your character has 4 main parts, your race, class, background, and stats. This page will explain each of these parts.
</p>

<!-- Character race text -->
<h3> <strong> Race </strong> </h3>
<p>
Every single character, monster, townsperson, enemy, etc in dnd has a race. Your race is what your character is, some examples are: human, goblin, or orc. Your race can give you a bonus to certain stats for example an orc gets more <u>strength</u>.
</p>


<!-- Character class text, this section will have lists -->
<h3> <strong> Class </strong> </h3>
<p>
Your class is the core of your character, it determines what skills, abilities, and gear you have access to. There are 12 different classes you can choose from. If it’s your first time playing a fighter is a good choice. Fighters are simpler than some of the other classes.
</p>

<ul>
<li> <p> Barbarian, melee fighters that use rage to get stronger </p> </li>

<li> <p> Bard, magic users that get their magic from music to support their team </p> </li>

</ul>


<!-- Backgrounds section -->
<h3> <strong> Backgrounds </strong> </h3>
<p>
Your background is what your character was doing before the game, were they a knight serving the king, a criminal robbing caravans, a chef, etc. You choose your background from a large list of options which can be found on the app or website you use for your character. Your background also determines some of the gear you start with.
</p>

<!-- Stats section, needs lists and tables -->
<h3> <strong> Stats </strong> </h3>
<p>
Stats are your character's physical and mental abilities. Depending on what class you play as, you'll want to have certain stats higher than others. A melee fighter like a barbarian would want to have more <u>strength</u>; whereas, a wizard would want to have more <u>intelligence</u>. 
<br>
The six stats are:
</p>

<ul>
<li> <p> Strength STR</p> </li>

<li> <p> Dexterity DEX</p> </li>

<li> <p> Constitution CON</p> </li>

<li> <p> Intelligence INT</p> </li>

<li> <p> Wisdom WIS </p> </li>

<li> <p> Charisma CHA </p> </li>
</ul>

<p>
Each stat gives you a modifier, 10 is the average number, if you have below 10 you get a minus, if you have above 10 you get a plus. 
</p>

<!-- stats continued -->
<p>
How you get your stats is simple. First you roll 4d6, once you’ve rolled them, get rid of the die with the lowest number and add up the scores of the 3 remaining dice. Once you have that number write it down somewhere. Repeat this process until you have 6 numbers written down, then take those numbers and assign each of them to one of your stats. Each race also gives a bonus to stats. Some races have specific stats they give a bonus, others give the player the option to pick which stats get buffed.
<br>
<br>
Example - Steve rolls 4d6, he rolls a 4, 3, 5, and 2. He gets rid of the lowest, in this case a 2, and is left with a 4, 3, and 5. Steve adds those numbers for a total of 12, he writes that number down and repeats this process until he has 6 numbers. After getting all 6 numbers Steve has a 12, 14, 5, 9, 11, and 13, he then assigns each of them to a stat. STR 12, DEX 13, CON 14, INT 5, WIS 9, CHA 11. Steve is playing as a human which gains a plus 1 to every stat making his final stats STR 13, DEX 14, CON 15, INT 6, WIS 10, CHA 12.
Steve’s modifier in each stat is STR +1, DEX +2, CON +2, INT -2, WIS 0, CHA +1.
</p>

<!-- Health section -->
<h3> <strong> Hit Dice and Health </strong> </h3>
<p>
Your character has hit dice, you have an amount of hit dice equal to your level. Hit dice are used to heal when you short rest and decide how much health your character has. Each class has a certain die as their hit die. 
<br>
d6 for sorcerer, wizard
<br>
d8 for artificer, bard, cleric, druid, monk, rogue, warlock
<br> 
d10 for fighter, paladin, ranger
<br>
d12 for barbarian
<br>
<br>
When you level up (including when you make your character at level 1) you roll 1 of your classes hit die and add your <u>constitution</u> modifier, add that number to your max health for your new total.
<br>
<br>
Example - Steve’s character is a bard meaning his hit die is a d8, he also has a <u>constitution</u> modifier of +3. Steve rolls 1d8 getting a 5, he then adds his +3 modifier for a total of 8 max health added.
</p>

<!-- Leveling up section -->
<h3> <strong> Leveling up </strong> </h3>
<p>
In dnd character levels go from 1-20. Leveling up gives your character new abilities that are specific to your chosen class.
<br>
<br>
There are 2 options for how to track when you level up.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Option 1 XP</strong>
<br>
Every enemy in dnd has an XP value and when you defeat that enemy you gain their XP value. When you reach the required amount of XP for the next level, you level up.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Option 2 Milestone</strong>
<br>
With milestone leveling you level up when the DM decides that you do. The DM decides when you level up based on having defeated a tough boss, or reaching a certain point in the story, or any other reason they want.
