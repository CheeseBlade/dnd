Welcome to Dungeons and Dragons Explained.
<br>
<br>
This website will provide you with the basic information of Dungeons and Dragons because the official rulebooks can be quite overwhelming for newcomers. This site does not contain every single thing there is to know about Dungeons and Dragons as it is meant to act as a quick start guide. This site provides the basic information needed to start playing, but there are links to sites that contain the entirety of Dungeons and Dragons rules found on the "Other resources" page. For newcomers it is recommended to start with the top link and make your way down the list after you finish reading this page.

<!-- What is dnd paragraph -->
<h3> <strong> What is Dungeons and Dragons? </strong> </h3>

<p>
Dungeons and Dragons or Dnd for short is a tabletop role playing game or TTRPG. It is a game where a group of people play through an adventure. Dnd is a group of people pretending to be characters in a world, going on adventures and doing whatever else they want to do. If you can think of it, it can probably be done. 1 person is the dungeon master (DM) the DM controls the world, they create the story for everyone else who's playing. Everyone else is a player, they each have a character and they control and role play as this character. The gameplay of dnd is essentially a back and forth between the DM describing the scene and the players describing their response to the scene. 
</p>


<!-- Paragraph on dice -->
<h3> <strong> Dice </strong> </h3>
<p>
The other big factor in dnd is dice rolls, most actions are determined by rolling a die. Want to sneak into a castle, roll for it. Want to attack a dragon, roll for it. You get the picture, everything you do comes down to a dice roll, but not normal dice. In dnd you use a set of 7 different dice, the names of each die are simple, it starts with a ‘d’ for dice followed by the number of sides. The standard dice you find in any board game is called a d6 because it has 6 sides.
<br>
The 7 dice are as follows - d4, d6, d8, d10, d12, d20, and d100.
<br>
Note - the d100 doesn’t actually have 100 sides, it has 10 sides like a d10, but instead of showing numbers 1-10 it shows 10, 20, 30… up to 100.

<!-- Paragraph on roleplay concerns -->
<h3> <strong> Roleplay Concerns </strong> </h3>
<p>
It isn’t always easy to jump straight into role play and fully acting as, and pretending to be this other character, and you don’t need to. If it makes it easier for you you can just describe it, instead of saying something threatening to someone you’re trying to intimidate you can just say “my character says something intimidating”. After playing for a while you may become comfortable enough to start acting as your character the entire time, but it isn’t required. You can roleplay as much or as little as makes you comfortable.

<!-- Paragraph on things you need -->
<h3> <strong> Things you need </strong> </h3>
<ul>

<li> <p> A set of dice for dnd, these can be found on amazon or at most game shops </p> </li>

<li> <p> An app or website for your character information, you can find these online by googling it, but the app I recommend is the "5e companion app" </p> </li>

<li> <p> People to play with, you need 3-5 people for a good game of dnd, if you don’t know anyone who is also interested in dnd some game stores have dnd nights that you could check out </p> </li>

</ul>
