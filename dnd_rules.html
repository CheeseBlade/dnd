<!-- Ability checks -->
<h3> <strong> Ability Checks </strong> </h3>
<p>
Whenever you take an action of some kind you’ll have to make an ability check. Your DM will tell you when to roll and what ability or stat you’re using. Ability checks are always a d20 plus any bonus you have in that stat. Maybe you wanted to break down a door, the DM would tell you to make a <u>strength</u> ability check, you would roll a d20 and add your <u>strength modifier</u> to the roll. The DM then takes that number and tells you whether you succeed or not. There are 2 special occurrences when you make an ability check. If you roll a 1 or 20 before you add any modifier you either instantly fail (1) or succeed (20).
</p>

<!-- Contest -->
<h3> <strong> Contest </strong> </h3>
<p>
Sometimes you’ll have to make an <u>ability check</u> against another's ability check, this is called a contest. If you are in a contest you and whoever you are in a contest with both make the <u>ability check</u> that specific contest requires you to make. Whoever has the highest roll wins the contest.
</p>

<!-- Advantage and Disadvantage -->
<h3> <strong> Advantage and Disadvantage </strong> </h3>
<p>
When you make an <u>ability check</u> you may have advantage or disadvantage depending on the scenario. If you have advantage when you make an <u>ability check</u> you roll 2 d20 and use the higher roll. If you have disadvantage when you make an <u>ability check</u> you roll 2 d20 and use the lower roll.
</p>

<!-- Short Rests -->
<h3> <strong> Short Rests </strong> </h3>
<p>
To short rest you have to spend 1 hour resting, meaning anything that doesn’t put a physical strain on your character. Eating, sleeping, and reading are common ways for your character to pass the time. If you rest for the full hour you get to heal using your <u>hit dice</u>. To heal roll 1 of your <u>hit dice</u>, take that number and add your <u>constitution</u> modifier to it, you heal that much health. The hit die you rolled is removed from the amount of <u>hit dice</u> you have until you <u>long rest</u>. You can spend up to your total available hit dice when you short rest, but they are a limited resource. 
<br>
<br>
Example - Steve is playing a bard which has a d8 <strong>hit die</strong>. Steve is at 8 health, he has a max health of 30, he has a <u>constitution</u> modifier of +2, and he is level 3 meaning he has 3 <u>hit dice</u>. He rests for 1 hour and wants to heal. Steve rolls 1d8, rolling a 6 and adding his <u>constitution</u> modifier of +2 he heals 8 health putting him a 16 health with 2 hit dice left. He can repeat this process 2 more times since he has 2 more <u>hit dice</u>.
</p>

<!-- Long Rests -->
<h3> <strong> Long Rests </strong> </h3>
<p>
To long rest you have to spend 8 hours resting, meaning anything that doesn’t put a physical strain on your character. Eating, sleeping, and reading are common ways for your character to pass the time. When you finish a long rest you get all of your resources back. You heal to your max health, you get all your <u>spell slots</u> back, you get all your <u>hit dice</u> back, and you get any other ability your class or race has back.
</p>

<!-- Spell Slots -->
<h3> <strong> Spell Slots </strong> </h3>
<p>
Some classes have access to spells. There are 2 types, <u>cantrips</u>, and <u>leveled spells</u>. <u>Cantrips</u> are free to use as much as you want. <u>Leveled spells</u> cost 1 spell slot. A spell slot is a resource that you need to cast a spell. Each class that has access to spells has a certain amount of spell slots that gets larger as they level up. Spells have a level of 1-9 the higher the level the more powerful it is. When you use a <u>leveled spell</u> you remove a spell slot of equal level. For example if you cast a level 2 spell you spend 1 level 2 spell slot. You get your <u>spell slots</u> back when you <u>long rest</u>.
</p>

<!-- Combat section -->
<h2> <strong> Combat </strong> </h2>
<p>
Combat in dnd is turn based, on your turn you have a set amount of things you can do. After each player and enemy has taken their turn the round is over and the next round starts. All of the actions and everything else to do with the enemies is controlled by the DM.
</p>

<!-- Initiative -->
<h3> <strong> Initiative </strong> </h3>
<p>
Turn order in combat is decided by each player and enemy rolling for initiative. Roll a d20 and add your <u>dexterity</u> modifier to the roll. Once everyone has rolled the turn order goes from the highest roll to the lowest.
</p>

<!-- Action section, has a list and link -->
<h3> <strong> Action </strong> </h3>
<p>
On your turn you get 1 action. This action has multiple uses which are listed below.
</p>

<ul>
<li> <p> Attack </p> </li>

<!-- Bonus action -->
<h3> <strong> Bonus Action </strong> </h3>
<p>
On each turn you get 1 bonus action. Your bonus action doesn’t have any uses unless your class gives you an ability that costs a bonus action. 
<br>
<br>
Example - Rogues get the ability to use <u>dash</u>, <u>disengage</u>, <u>dodge</u>, and <u>help</u> as a bonus action instead of an action.
</p>

<!-- Reaction -->
<h3> <strong> Reaction </strong> </h3>
<p>
During each round you get 1 reaction. Your reaction is used on other peoples turns to do certain abilities. Every character can spend their reaction to make an <u>opportunity attack</u> and some classes have abilities that cost 1 reaction.
</p>

<!-- Opportunity Attack -->
<h3> <strong> Opportunity Attack </strong> </h3>
<p>
An opportunity attack can be made when an enemy is within 5 feet of you and moves out of that five foot space or vice versa. When you make an opportunity attack it costs 1 <u>reaction</u>, and you make an <u>attack</u> on the enemy with the weapon that you are wielding. 
</p>

<!-- Movement -->
<h3> <strong> Movement </strong> </h3>
<p>
When moving during combat the area you’re fighting in is made up of a grid of 5 foot by 5 foot squares. Every creature usually takes up 1 of these squares, an exception being if they are very large, creatures like dragons being an example. Every creature has a movement speed. Most races have a movement speed of 30 feet but some races have less or more. If you have 30 feet of movement you can move across 6 tiles, and this works in all directions.
</p>

<!-- Death Saves -->
<h3> <strong> Death Saves </strong> </h3>
<p>
If a player's health reaches 0 they don’t immediately die, players have a chance to survive. A player makes a death save every single turn that they are at 0 health. A death save is made by rolling 1d20 there are no modifiers to this role. A roll of 10 or higher is a success, a roll below 10 is a fail. If you roll a 20 you get 3 successes’ and if you roll a 1 you get 2 failures. If a player fails 3 times they die, if they succeed 3 times they are stable at 1 health.
